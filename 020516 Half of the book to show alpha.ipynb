    "they do n t make me say if i love troy or if i do n t dabney was thinking clicking her heels in the pantry\n",
    "but by the time she came back to the porch the flowers in a mason jar of water she knew she would never say anything about love after all if they did n t want her to\n",
    "suppose they were afraid to ask her little old aunts\n",

    "they would give her anything but they would n t touch it again now for the world\n",
    "it was a wedding present\n",

    "she told him but he did not half listen\n",
    "he was looking at her intently as they went through the hall and into the dining room\n",
    "nobody was there\n",
    "he threw his coat and hat down and fell with a groan on the settee which trembled under him the way it always did\n",
    "warm day he said at last and shut his eyes\n",
    "roxie brought him the pitcher of lemonade and he lifted up to drink a glass politely but he would not have any cake just them\n",
    "i ll stretch a minute he hold ellen and at once his eyes shut again\n",
    "she took his shoes off and he blinds a little but he seemed far gone already with that intensity with which all the fairchilds slept\n",

    "ca n t tell jim allen and hurt them\n",
    "of course do n t tell any of the girls george said line\n",
    "look george battle said at length\n",
    "what s that sister of her s name\n",
    "rebel reid\n",
    "i bet you anything i ve got robbie s with rebel\n",
    "i ve a very good notion she is george said\n",
    "there were voices in the hall vi let s and somebody s a vaguely familiar voice\n",
    "troy s here\n",
    "what s he doing here\n",
    "ellen looked at battle\n",
    "oh he s invited to supper\n",
    "man\n",
    "why do n t you go get her are you paralyzed\n",
    "then wring her neck\n",
    "did you go are you going\n",
    "battle turned his eyes from george to ellen shelley bluet and around to troy standing foxy haired and high shouldered in the door his slow smile beginning to invite indignation\n",
    "what else is in your coat uncle george\n",
    "ranny asked politely in the silence\n",
    "no i m not going george went through his coat pulling everything out and kept watching how ranny squatted down opening a present with fingers careful enough to unlock some strange mystery in the world\n",
    "oh george ellen was saying\n",
    "oh battle\n",
    "she looked from one to the other then went to watch helplessly at the darkening window where they could heal the horses coming\n",
    "here s dabney\n",
    "as dabney and india rode in uncle george was coming down the front steps to meet them\n",
    "he always met them like that and they could tell him from anybody in the world\n",
    "he called dabney s name across the yard his white shirt sleeve waved in the dark p53he helped them down with the night light and dabney took it from him with a little predatory click of the tongue\n",
    "everything s fine with you i hear said george\n",
    "troy s in the house and dabney brushed against him and kissed him\n",
    "india saw troy\n",
    "it s all right dabney said coolly enough and ran up the steps\n",
    "but they heard it running she dropped the little night night and it broke and its pieces scattered\n",
    "they heard that but no cry at all only the opening and closing of the screen door as she went inside\n",
    "india ran up to uncle george and flung herself against his knees and beat on his legs\n",
    "she could not stop crying though uncle george himself stayed out there holding her and in a little began teasing her about a little old piece of glass that dabney would never miss it was so hard to read at shellmound\n",
    "there was so much going on in real life\n",
    "laura had tried to read under the bed that morning but dabney had found her and pulled her out by the foot\n",
    "now with volume i of saint s well inside her pinafore next to her skin she went tiptoeing in the direction of the library where no nothing except the sounds of the negroes and the slow ceiling fan turning in the hall and the submissive panting of the dogs just outside under the banana plants lying up close to the house\n",
    "even mary lamar mackey had gone to greenwood\n",
    "laura generally hesitated just a little in every doorway\n",
    "a big town with twenty five thousand people and fairchildswas just a store and a gin and a bridge and one big house yet she was the one who felt like a little country cousin when she arrived appreciating that she had come to where everything was dressy splendid and over her head\n",
    "demoniacally she tried to be part of it she took a breath and whirled went ahead of then she would fall down a humiliated little girl whose grief people never seemed to remember\n",
    "the very breath of preparation in the air drawing in or letting out hurried or deep and slow made dabney s wedding seem as fateful in the house as her mother of this morning moment was only waiting for laughter or tears\n",
    "even from the door the library smelled of a tremendous had come through high water and fire in port gibson and had now been left open on a stand probably by shelley\n",
    "on the long wall above the piles of bookcases and darker than the dark stained books was a painting of 26 1227 toolong whose name was written on the flyleaf of the dictionary\n",
    "it was done from memory by his brother great grandfather george fairchild a tall up and down picture on a slab of walnut showing him on his horse with his saddlebags and pistols pausing on a dark path between high banks smiling not down at people but straight out into the room his light hair gone dark as pressed wildflowers\n",
    "his little black dogs that he loved as a little boy great grandfather had put in too\n",
    "did he look as if he would be murdered\n",
    "certainly he did and he was\n",
    "side by side with old battle s picture by a real painter changelessly sparkling and fair though he had died in mexico marching on a foreign land\n",
    "behind the glass in the bookcases hiding the books and out on the tables were the velvet cases that opened like little square books themselves\n",
    "among them were aunt ellen s poor mother who had married some lord in england or had died and the three brothers and the husbands of aunt mac and aunt shannon who could not be told apart from one another by the children but no matter what hide and seek went on here in this room where so many dead young fairchilds ruined people were there seemed to be always consciousness of their gazes so courteous and meditative they were\n",
    "coming in gratefully bringing out her book laura felt it wordlessly the animation of the living generations in the house had not even in forgetting identity rebuked this gentleness because the gentleness was still there in their own faces part of pondering forehead the offered cheek the lonely body broad shoulder slender hand the long pressing thigh of old battle fairchild against his horse florian\n",
    "she turned and there by the mantel was uncle george\n",
    "uncle george every minute being welcomed and never alone was alone now except that is for vi let leaning from a stepladder with one knee on a bookcase very slowly taking down the velvet curtains\n",
    "he was rearing tall by the mantel the gold clock and the children s switches at his head wearing his white city clothes but coatless and his finger moved along the open edge of a blue envelope which in his hand then appeared an object from a star\n",
    "he gave laura a serious look as she stood in the middle of the room unconsciously offering him her open book with both hands\n",
    "over his shoulder stared the small oval portrait of aunt ellen in virginia stating flatly her early beauty her oval face in the lips almost argumentative\n",
    "there was nothing at all abstract in uncle george s look like the abstraction of painted people of most interrupted real people\n",
    "there was only penetration in his look and it reached to her\n",
    "so serious was it that she backed away out of the library into the hall and backwards out the screen door\n",
    "outside she picked up a striped kitten that was stalking through the grass blades and held him to her pressing against the tumult in her fingers and in his body\n",
    "the willful little face was like a question close to hers and the small stems of its breath came up and tickled her nose like flowers\n",
    "in front of her eyes the cardinals were flying hard at their reflections in the car drawn up in the yard now they had got back from greenwood\n",
    "a lady cardinal was in the rosebush hard that she throbbed between her shoulder blades\n",
    "laura could see herself in the car door too holding the at herself reflected there as if she had gotten along so far like an adventurer in an invisible coat as magical as it was unsuspected by her\n",
    "now she felt visible to everything\n",
    "the screen door opened behind her and uncle george came out on the porch\n",
    "they were calling him somewhere\n",
    "she could see him in the red door his hands were in his pockets and the letter was not showing on him\n",
    "skeeta\n",
    "like shelley s kitten\n",
    "he remarked\n",
    "no she said dropping it in the sheer perversity of excitement because she thought that whatever had happened he hoped laura still liked shelley s kitten\n",
    "now it chased the cardinals which darted and scolded though the lady cardinal sang on\n",
    "what do you like best of anything in the world\n",
    "he asked lighting his pipe now\n",
    "riddles she answered\n",
    "uncle george\n",
    "they cried but he began asking her as i was could all do was to take an old riddle and make it sound like a new one their own one she said you\n",
    "you were going to st ives all by your self\n",
    "out of all those\n",
    "only me\n",
    "then dabney came out and grabbed him and he looked over her head at laura pretending he could not believe what he heard as if he expected anything in the world to happen a new answer to the riddle which she laura had not given him\n",
    "while they were all still seated around the table drinking their last coffee mr rondo the methodist preacher at fairchilds paid a noon call\n",
    "they were all tired trying to make aunt shannon eat\n",
    "eat aunt shannon you ve had no more than a bird\n",
    "how can i eat child aunt shannon would say mysteriously when there s nothing to eat\n",
    "they did not expect ellen saw he considered his dropping in a nice thing since he was to marry dabney and troy so soon\n",

    "i m afraid i m not much of a sunday school girl dabney told mr rondo demurely as he took her hand but i m the bride\n",
    "by all means\n",
    "said mr rondo his voice hearty but uncertain\n",
    "iie sat in battle s chair\n",
    "battle sat down on a little needle and gave mr rondo a rather argumentative look\n",

    "fooling with practicing law in memphis now we re hoping he ll give it up and move back\n",

    "of course\n",
    "you did you did\n",
    "they got you out of bed in the middle of the night you knew about it before we did\n",

    "it s in their faces i do n t know if you pay much attention to that kind of thing mr rondo\n",
    "in their faces\n",
    "dabney asked looking at her mother in astonishment\n",
    "i was thinking of one picnic night particularly dear\n",
    "ellen s voice suddenly trembled\n",
    "you mean when they put on the rape of the sabines down at the grove\n",
    "asked battle\n",
    "a family picnic\n",
    "ellen smiled at the preacher firmly\n",
    "you should have come to dinner\n",
    "she offered her hand seeming to reproach him for not being invited\n",
    "but battle had said when she spoke of inviting him to one meal before the rehearsal supper who wants a preacher to eat with them\n",
    "as if he would have enjoyed the turkey too\n",
    "a good deal yes a great deal in people s faces he said\n",
    "well entertain mr rondo\n",
    "tell him about george on i bet he d like that said battle\n",
    "you tell it shelley\n",

    "all right india\n",
    "very simply now india said ellen calmly\n",

    "it was late in the afternoon\n",
    "cried india joining her hands she came close to mr rondo and stood in front of him\n",
    "just before the thunderstorm\n",
    "immediately in shelley s delicate face ellen could see reflected as if she felt a physical blow now the dark rather brutal colors of let her alone ellen\n",
    "what we d been doing was fishing all sunday morning in drowning lake\n",
    "it was everybody but papa and mama they missed it\n",
    "it was me dabney and shelley orrin and roy little battle and ranny and bluet uncle george and aunt robbie mama when s she coming\n",

    "came home on the railroad track came through the swamp\n",
    "came to the trestle\n",
    "everybody wanted to walk it but aunt robbie said no\n",
    "no indeed she had city heels and would never go on the trestle\n",
    "so she sat down plump but we were n t going to carry her\n",
    "we started across\n",
    "then shelley could n t walk it either\n",
    "she could n t look down\n",
    "everybody knows there is n t any water in dry creek in the summertime\n",
    "did you know that mr rondo\n",
    "i believe that is the case said mr rondo when india waited\n",
    "well shelley went down the bank and walked through it\n",
    "i was singing a song i know\n",
    "i ll measure my love to show you i ll measure my love to show you that s enough of the song said dabney tensely for we have gained the day\n",

    "the dog\n",
    "and she yelled like a banshee and the yellow dog was coming creep creep down the track with a flag on it\n",
    "a flag\n",
    "cried dabney\n",

    "bluet who had never taken her eyes off him laughed delightedly and circled round him\n",
    "george watched her a faint smile on his face\n",
    "it could n t stop india it was n t that it did n t care\n",
    "dabney o frowned\n",
    "mr doolittle was asleep\n",
    "the engineer you know\n",
    "she smiled at mr rondo\n",
    "who s telling this\n",
    "creep creep\n",
    "then it was time for aunt robbie to jump up in her high heels and call george\n",
    "come back\n",
    "but he did n t\n",
    "all right sweethearts jump uncle george says and the first one to jump was me\n",
    "i landed on my feet and seat in an old snaky place\n",
    "i made a horrible noise when i was going through the air like this\n",
    "i looked up and saw dabney get ranny in her arms and jump holding him the craziest thing she ever did but ranny said do it again\n",
    "his hands instead of jumping and little battle had to climb back and do it too\n",
    "look how ashamed they look\n",
    "they got cinders in their eyes both of them\n",
    "uncle george threw bluet off and shelley picked her up\n",
    "i forgot to say all the negroes had run to the four corners of the earth and we could hear pinchy yelling like a banshee from way up in a tree\n",
    "that was before she started coming through\n",
    "go faster said dabney\n",
    "mr rondo will get bored\n",
    "oh well maureen caught her foot\n",
    "she was dancing up there and that s what she did caught her foot good\n",
    "uncle george said to hold still a minute and he d get it loose but he could n t get her foot loose at all\n",
    "so creep creep\n",
    "it was coming fast\n",
    "cried dabney\n",
    "mr rondo the whistle was blowing like everything by that time\n",
    "mr the whistle was blowing said india but the dog was not coming very fast\n",
    "aunt robbie was crying behind us and saying come back george\n",
    "and shelley said jump jump\n",
    "but he just stayed on the trestle with maureen\n",
    "path of least resistance\n",
    "battle beamed at mr rondo fiercely\n",
    "path george s taken all his life\n",
    "hurry up india said dabney\n",
    "hurry up india said ranny and bluet banging dessert spoons on the back of the preacher s chair\n",
    "now be still or i wo n t let india go any further ellen said her hand on her breast\n",
    "then bluet beat her spoon very softly\n",
    "oh well maureen said litt la train ain can na get la by y and stuck her arms out\n",
    "battle gave a short laugh\n",
    "india you re a sight you ought to go on the stage\n",
    "hurry up india\n",
    "well maureen and uncle george kind of wrestled with each other and both of them fell off and anyway the dog stopped in plenty time and we all went home and robbie was mad at uncle george\n",
    "i expect they had a fight all right\n",
    "and that s all\n",
    "bluet whimpered\n",
    "yes that s all bluet said ellen\n",
    "india you tell what you know about and then stop that s the way\n",
    "now wait\n",
    "tell what robbie said when it was all over india said battle turning the corners of his mouth down\n",
    "listen mr rondo\n",
    "robbie said george fairchild you did n t do this for me\n",
    "battle roared with cross laughter from his stool\n",
    "dabney cried you should have heard her\n",
    "shelley went white\n",
    "robbie said george fairchild you did n t do this for me\n",
    "shelley ca n t stand anything it looks like with all this dabney excitement said battle\n",
    "now do n t let me see you cry\n",
    "leave me alone shelley said\n",
    "she s crying india said with finality\n",
    "look mr rondo she s the oldest\n",
    "who is maureen\n",
    "asked mr rondo pleasantly\n",
    "is she this little girl\n",
    "he pointed at laura\n",
    "oh no i was n t there laura said a little fastidiously\n",
    "he was fully told that maureen had been dropped on her head as an infant that her mother virgie lee fairchild who had dropped her ran away into fairchilds and lived by herself never came out and that she wore her black hair hanging and matted to the waist had not combed it since the day she let the child fall\n",
    "you ve seen her\n",
    "their two lives had stopped up at shellmound\n",
    "why she s denis s child\n",
    "they all said\n",
    "she s just as much fairchild as you are said battle\n",
    "so don t ever let me catch you getting stuck up in your life\n",
    "he gave laura a look\n",
    "is maureen my first cousin\n",
    "laura cried\n",
    "we re kin to maureen the same as we re kin to each other shelley told her\n",
    "on the fairchild side\n",
    "her papa was uncle denis and he was killed in the war do n t you remember\n",
    "i forgot said laura\n",
    "when will she comb her hair\n",
    "we ll let you know when she does\n",
    "shelley and dabney giggled looking at each other\n",
    "i guess i d better be going said mr rondo\n",
    "midday s a busy time to call\n",
    "but i know she wo n t comb it for your wedding dabney said battle\n",
    "you might think your marrying troy flavin would bring anything about but it wo n t make your aunt virgie lee take the tangles out of her hair\n",
    "and he laughed on groaning as if it hurt his side\n",
    "and dabney suddenly left the table\n",
    "she had to be called three times but when she came down she looked rather softened at being teased about her love before everybody\n",
    "mr rondo had already taken his departure promising to be back to the rehearsal and supper on friday night they said they would show him just what to do\n",
    "ellen stood at the foot of the stairs holding a cup of broth\n",
    "george came out of the dining room lighting his pipe and went to her\n",
    "i know i should worry a little more about aunt shannon she began and he lifted the napkin and looked at the broth\n",
    "have a taste she said sighing\n",
    "she s stubborn too george said\n",
    "i sent drink it for her\n",
    "she sent the poor little thing back\n",
    "he nodded\n",
    "aunt shannon never wept over laura as if she could not do it over one motherless child or give her any\n",
    "in her the fairchild oblivion to the member of the family standing alone was most developed just as in years past its opposite the fairchild sense of emergency a dramatic instinct was in its ascendancy and she had torn herself to pieces over denis s drinking and denis s getting killed\n",
    "insistently a little messenger or reminder of death laura self consciously struck her pose again and again but she was a child too familiar too like all her cousins too much one of them as they all were to one another a part of their very own continuousness at times ever to get the attention she begged for\n",
    "by aunt shannon in particular the members of the family were always looked on with that and love out of which the single personality does not gently like a star when it is time into the sky and by simply emerging drifts back into the general view and belongs to the multitudinous heavens\n",
    "all were dear all were unfathomable all were constantly speaking as the stars would ever twinkle imploringly or not so far so far away\n",
    "you take her the broth george\n",
    "i believe she would drink it for you\n",
    "maybe so\n",
    "some days she thinks i m grandfather or denis he said without rancor\n",
    "she still held on to the bowl not able to worry enough about aunt shannon\n",
    "how in his family s eyes george could lie like a fallen tower as easily as he could be raised to extravagant heights\n",
    "now if he was fallen it was because of his ordinary wife but once it had been because he gave away the grove and before that something else\n",
    "the slightest pressure of his actions would modify the wonder lower or raise it\n",
    "whereas even virgie lee had never taken anything away from the pure unvarying glory of denis\n",
    "tell her to drink it for you she said and held out the bowl to him very carefully\n",
    "ile took it with the touching helpfulness of her son ranny\n",
    "she watched him carrying it upstairs\n",
    "not for the first time she wondered whether if it had never been for denis george might not have been completely the hero to his family instead of sometimes almost its hero and sometimes almost its sacrificial beast\n",
    "but she thought that she could tell as george turned on the landing and gave her a look as sweet as a child s of not to be anxious that he was more remarkable than either and not owing to denis s spectacular life or death but to his being in himself all that denis no longer was a human being and a complex man\n",
    "battle came down the hall with a hangdog look and she met him and comforted him down he said\n",
    "if i were n t tied down\n",
    "i d go find little upstart reid myself and kill her\n",
    "no i d set her and flavin together and feed em to each other\n",
    "mr rondo came at the wrong time ellen said kissing him\n",
    "it just was n t a good day for mr rondo\n",
    "go to sleep bluet go to sleep said ellen monotonously to her baby\n",
    "the house was nearly still from below came faint noises from the kitchen and from somewhere one little theme over and over on the piano\n",
    "mary lamar mackey played all day the whole of her visit as if the summer must speak a yearning each day through yet never enough could she bring it to speak\n",
    "nocturnes were her joy\n",
    "go to sleep bluet and i ll tell you my dream\n",
    "dream\n",
    "bluet was a gentle little thing inquiring more gently admiration and innumerable kinds of small pleasures she was younger\n",
    "all day she worked carrying on like a busy housewife her loves and hates without knowing her small life was an open window where they all looked in and smiled at her\n",
    "now she lay in one of the big white painted iron sleeping porch beds with the mosquito net folded back against its head it was like a big baby buggy that too would carry her away somewhere against her will\n",
    "do you hear the dove mama\n",
    "outside the summer day shimmered and rustled and the porch seemed to flow with light and shadow that traveled outwards\n",
    "in a low voice ellen told her dream to put the child to sleep\n",
    "with one hand she held down her little girl s leg which wanted to kick like a dancer s\n",
    "gradually it gave up\n",
    "mama dreamed about a thing she lost long time ago before you were born\n",
    "it was a little red breastpin and she wanted to find went to see she went to the woods by james s bayou and on and on\n",
    "she came to a great big tree\n",
    "great big tree breathed the child\n",
    "hundreds of years old never chopped down that great big tree\n",
    "and under the tree was sure enough that little breastpin\n",
    "it was shining in the leaves like fire\n",
    "she went and knelt down and took her pin back pinned it to her breast and wore it\n",
    "yes she took her pin back she pinned it to her breast to her breast and wore it away away bluet s eyelids fell and her dancing leg was still\n",
    "her lips but with a soft sigh and a rapid taking back of the lost breath she was past the moment when she could have protested\n",
    "she was asleep for the afternoon\n",
    "the dream ellen told bluet was an actual one for it would never have occurred to her to tell anything untrue to a child often told dreams to bluet at bedtime and nap time for they were convenient the only things she knew that were not real\n",
    "ellen herself had always rather trusted her dreams\n",
    "it was her weakness she knew and it was right for the children as they grew up to deride her and so she usually told them to the youngest\n",
    "however she dreamed the location of mistakes in the accounts and the payroll that her husband not a born business man had let pass and discovered how mr bascom had cheated them and stolen so much and she dreamed whether any of the connection needed her in their various places the grove inverness or the tenants down the river and they always did when she got there\n",
    "she dreamed of things the children and negroes lost and of where they were and often when she looked she did find them or parts of them in the dreamed of places\n",
    "she was too busy when she was awake to know if dream it\n",
    "it was the night before that she had the dream she lured bluet to sleep with\n",
    "actually it had been in the form of a warning she had left that out for bluet s domestic but bloodthirsty little heart would have made her get up and dance on the bed to learn what a warning was\n",
    "she was warned that her garnet brooch a present in courting days from her husband that had been lying around the house for years and then disappeared lay in the leaves under a giant cypress tree on the other side of the bayou\n",
    "she had it during the confusion of the morning and of dinnertime and since when dabney burst into tears and ran out crying excuse me for living\n",
    "now the feeling of being warned returned rather pleasantly than not to ellen s bosom she put a little sugared almond on bluet s pillow for her fairies gift and left the sleeping porch on tiptoe\n",
    "then while kitchen and back porch full of negroes sylvanus old partheny s son came to the door\n",
    "miss ellen\n",
    "partheny send for you\n",
    "say please come\n",
    "has she had a spell\n",
    "she in one said sylvanus\n",
    "say please miss ellen come\n",
    "not me stay with her mr troy git me\n",
    "run on back to the fields sylvanus i ll go\n",
    "she took off her apron after first filling a small pot with some of aunt shannon s broth for she might as well stop at little uncle s she thought where his wife sue ellen was going to have another one and not doing well and speak in person to oneida too about helping to dress all the chickens\n",
    "she put her head in at the dining room door\n",
    "there were just the two old aunts awake and about aunt shannon was calmly sewing a bit of stuff\n",
    "i m going out a little while said aunt mac\n",
    "aunt mac was three years younger than aunt shannon\n",
    "she had dyed black hair that she pulled down spreading its thin skein as far as it would go about her tiny rosy lobed ears\n",
    "little black across her forehead as if they alone were her hair and the rest were a cap an old fashioned winter toboggan with a small fuzzy ball at the peak which was her impatient knot\n",
    "she was little with age\n",
    "somewhere in mastering her dignity over life she had acquired the exaggerated walk of a small boy under her long black skirt and went around shellmound with her old wine colored lip stuck out as if she invited a dare\n",
    "her cheekbones like little gossamer covered drums stood out in her face on which rice powder twinkled when she sat in her place under the brightest lamp\n",
    "her sharp bright features looked out though she was quite deaf now as if she were indeed outdoors in her new cap a bright wide world looking for something to catch or maybe let get away this time\n",
    "she watched out but very exactingly she dressed herself in mourning for her husband duncan laws killed in the battle of corinth sixty years ago\n",
    "a watch crusted with diamonds was always pinned to the little hollow of her breast and she would make the children tell her the time by it right or wrong\n",
    "she whistled a tune sometimes some vaguely militant or presbyterian air that sounded archaic and perverse in a pantry where she would sometimes fling open the cupboard doors to see how nearly starving they were\n",
    "her smile when it came often for india was soft\n",
    "she gave a trifling hobble sometimes now when she walked but it seemed to be a flourish just to look busy\n",
    "her eyes were remarkable stone blue now and with all she had to do she had read the bible through nine times before she ever came to shellmound and started it there\n",
    "she and her allen s children when they had been left from denis aged twelve to george aged three after their dreadful trouble were glad to do it widows\n",
    "and though shannon drifted away sometimes in her mind and would forget where she was and speak to lucian as if he had not started out to war to be killed or to her brother battle the same way or to her brother george as if he had been found and were home again or to dead young denis she had loved best she mac had never let go never asked relenting from the present hour and if anything should god prevent it happen to ellen now she was prepared to do it again start in with young battle s children and bring them up\n",
    "she would start by throwing troy flavin in the bayou in front of the house and letting the minnows chew him up\n",
    "but aunt shannon when she would look around the room and know it would palmetto fan anything as if life were so piteous that all people had better content themselves with was to be waited on hand and foot tend or be tended the wave would fall and it was better to be tended\n",
    "ellen took one of the big black cotton umbrellas out of the stand and went out\n",
    "the sun did press down like a hot white stone\n",
    "the whole front yard was dazzling it was covered with all the lace curtains of the house drying on stretchers\n",
    "just then here came roy riding on his billy goat in and out just not touching all the curtains\n",
    "oh roy\n",
    "i did think you were asleep\n",
    "are you being careful\n",
    "i ll never touch a curtain or make the tiniest hole mama\n",
    "want to watch me\n",
    "no i trust you\n",
    "can i ride along behind you mama where you re going\n",
    "not this time she said\n",
    "butterflies lighting and clinging on the blazing fetid boards and walked leisurely down the other side on the old marmion path when there had been a river bridge up this far through the trees\n",
    "she had been weary today until now\n",
    "it seemed to her that dabney s wedding had made everybody feel a little headstrong this week the children flying out of the house without even pretending to ask permission and herself not being able as well as usual to keep up with any of it\n",
    "it was a clamorous family ellen knew and for her her and her brother in law george were the most clamorous\n",
    "she knew george was importunate how much that man hoped for\n",
    "much more than battle\n",
    "they should all fairly shield their eyes against that hope\n",
    "dabney did not really know yet for how much she asked\n",
    "but where george was importunate dabney was almost greedy\n",
    "dabney was actually at moments almost selfish and he was not\n",
    "that is she thought unselfishness which is a dread of selfishness but the thoughtless hasty kind which is often cheated of even its flower like a tender perennial that will disregard the winter earlier every year\n",
    "the umbrella was in her way now that she had come to the shade and she could wish she had brought a little negro along to carry it or the soup\n",
    "she noticed how many little paths crisscrossed and disappeared in here the deeper she went\n",
    "who had made them\n",
    "there had been more woods left standing here than she had remembered\n",
    "the shade was nice\n",
    "moss from the cypresses hung deep over head now and by the water vines like pediments and arches reached from one tree to the next\n",
    "she walked abstractedly gently moving her extended hand with the closed umbrella in it from side to side clearing the vines and mosquitoes from her path\n",
    "there were trumpet vines and passion flowers\n",
    "the cypress trunks four feet thick in the water s edge stood opened like doors of were\n",
    "here the bayou banks were cinders they said it was where the indians burned their pottery at the very last\n",
    "the songs of the cotton pickers were far away so were the hoofbeats of the horse the and once again listening for them in spite of the quiet she felt as if the cotton fields so solid to the sight had opened up and swallowed her daughter\n",
    "even inside this narrow but dense wood she found herself listening for sounds of the fields and house walking along almost anxiously enough to look back over her shoulder wondering if something needed her at home if bluet had waked up if for some unaccountable reason dabney had flown back from a party calling her mother\n",
    "then she heard a step a starting up in the woods\n",
    "who s that\n",
    "she called sharply\n",
    "come here to me\n",
    "there was no answer but she saw the way she moved in the woodsy light it was\n",
    "pinchy roxie s helper was these days and wandered around all day staring and moaning until she would see light\n",
    "but pinchy would answer miss ellen still\n",
    "are you one of our people\n",
    "girl are you lost then\n",
    "still there was no answer but no running away either\n",
    "ellen called come here to me i could tell you are about the size of one of my daughters\n",
    "and if you belong somewhere i m going to send you back unless they re mean to you you ca n t hide with me but if you do n t belong anywhere then i ll have to think\n",
    "now come out\n",
    "my soup s getting cold here for an old woman\n",
    "then since the girl remained motionless where she had been discovered ellen patiently made her way through the pulling vines and the old spider webs toward her\n",
    "she was dimly aware of the chimney to the overseer s house stuck up through the trees for a moment the girl was not a trespasser but someone who lived in the woods a dark creature not hiding but waiting to be seen careless on the pottery bank\n",
    "then she saw the corner of a little torn skirt poking out by the tree almost of itself trembling\n",
    "come out child it s luck i found you i was just looking for a little pin i lost she said\n",
    "i have n t seen no pin the girl said behind her tree\n",
    "when she heard the voice ellen stopped still\n",
    "she peered\n",
    "all at once she cried are n t you a negro\n",
    "the girl still only waited behind a tree but a quick alert breath came from her that ellen heard\n",
    "so she was white\n",
    "a whole mystery of life opened up\n",
    "ellen waited by a tree herself as if she could not go any farther through the woods\n",
    "almost bringing terror the thought of robbie reid crossed her curious of the two she looked around the tree\n",
    "ellen said calmly come out here in the light\n",
    "she came out and showed herself a beautiful girl fair and nourished round armed\n",
    "not long ago she had been laughing or crying\n",
    "she had been running\n",
    "her skin was white to transparency her hazel eyes looking not downward at the state of her skirt but levelly into the woods around and the bayou\n",
    "stand still said ellen\n",
    "it was a thing she said habitually often on her knees with pins in her mouth\n",
    "she herself was sternly still as if she expected presently to begin to speak and speech at such a time would likely be stern questions that perhaps would find no answers\n",
    "yet at her side her arms slowly felt light and except for their burdens her hands would have gone out to the shadowy girl she caught the motion back feeling a cool breath as if a rabbit had run over her grave or sometimes like a mother to the world all that was on her\n",
    "yet she had never felt a mother to a child this lovely\n",
    "the faint wind from the bayou blew in the girl s hair she had shaken out marking somehow the time going by in the woods\n",
    "none of her daughters stood this still in front of her they tore from her side\n",
    "or even in the morning when she went to their beds to wake them they never had a freshness like this which the soiled cheek the leafy hair the wide awake eyes made almost startling\n",
    "none of her daughters even dabney had a beauty which seemed to go out from them as they stood still every time she had ever said stand still had she hoped for this beauty\n",
    "in ellen s mind dimly was that poetic expression to shed beauty\n",
    "now she comprehended it as if a key to all the poetry denis once read had been given to her here in the bayou woods\n",
    "way out here in the woods\n",
    "said ellen\n",
    "you ll bring mistakes on yourself that way\n",
    "she waited a moment\n",
    "you re no fairchilds girl or inverness girl or round bayou or greenwood girl\n",
    "you re a stranger to me\n",
    "the girl did not give her any answer and she said i do n t believe you even know who i am\n",
    "i have n t seen no pin said the girl\n",
    "you re at the end of the world out here\n",
    "you re purely and simply wandering in the woods\n",
    "i ought to take a stick to you\n",
    "nobody can say i stole no pin\n",
    "ellen dropped the old black umbrella and took hold of the young girl s hand\n",
    "it was small calloused and warm\n",
    "i was n t speaking about any little possession to you\n",
    "i suppose i was speaking about good and bad maybe\n",
    "i was speaking about men men our\n",
    "the warm quiet hand was not attempting to withdraw and not holding to hers either\n",
    "how beautiful the lost girl was\n",
    "i m not stopping you ellen said\n",
    "i ought to turn you around and send you back or make you tell me where you re going or think you re going but i m not\n",
    "look at me i m not stopping you she said comfortably\n",
    "you could n t stop me the girl said comfortably also and a half smile sweet and incredibly maternal passed over her face\n",
    "it made what she said seem teasing and sad final and familiar like the advice a mother is bound to give her girls\n",
    "ellen let the little hand go\n",
    "in the stillness a muscadine fell from a high place into the leaves under their feet burying itself and like the falling grape the moment of comfort seemed visible to them and dividing them and to be then itself lost\n",
    "was the scared one not you ellen said\n",
    "she gathered herself together\n",
    "i reckon you scared me first coming now going\n",
    "in the beginning i did think i was seeing something in the woods a spirit my husband declares one haunts his bayou here then i thought it was pinchy an ignorant little negro girl on our place\n",
    "it was when i saw you were were a stranger my heart nearly failed me for some reason\n",
    "the girl looked down at the red glass buttons on her dress as if she began to feel a kind of pleasure in causing confusion\n",
    "which way is the big road please ma am\n",
    "she asked\n",
    "that way\n",
    "ellen pointed explicitly with her umbrella then drew it back slowly\n",
    "memphis she said\n",
    "when her voice trembled the name seemed to recede from something else into its legendary form the old delta synonym for pleasure trouble and shame and ellen could hear the fallen branches break softly under her foot\n",
    "a fleeting resentment that she did not understand flushed her cheeks she thought i did n t give her this little soup\n",
    "but still listening after her she knew that the girl did not care what she thought or would have given what ellen might have cast away with her that she never looked back\n",
    "go in and out the window go in and out the window they held hands high and then low and shelley who was it because she was the big girl ran stooping under their arms in and out\n",
    "they were playing in the shade of the pecan trees after naps and a ride to greenwood after the groceries shelley india bluet maureen ranny and laura\n",
    "cousin lady clare was just now sent by aunt mac out to play with them too\n",
    "she had come ahead of aunt tempe her grandmother to shellmound went around with her lower teeth biting her upper lip like william s hart\n",
    "little uncle s little boys were up in the yard crisscrossing with two lawn mowers cutting the grass for the wedding\n",
    "far in the back howard was beating the rugs with a very slow beat\n",
    "the sound of the lawn mowers was pleading they seemed to be saying please\n",
    "p please\n",
    "the children were keeping out of mischief so that other people could get something done shelley was obeying her mother too and this lowered her some in the eyes of them all white and colored\n",
    "for we have gained the day lady clare said to laura ask shelley can troy french kiss\n",
    "i m sure he can laura said loftily for she had been here a day longer than lady clare whatever french kissing might be\n",
    "the song and the game were dreamlike to her\n",
    "it was nice to have shelley in the circle but then it was sometimes you wanted to be in a circle and then you wanted out of it in a rush\n",
    "sometimes the circle was for you sometimes against you if you were it\n",
    "sometimes in the circle you longed for the lone outsider to come in sometimes you could n t wait and knowing the song\n",
    "a circle was ugly without you\n",
    "she knew how ugly it was from the face maureen would make to see it and to change this she would let her in\n",
    "even if she did not maureen would get in\n",
    "maureen was a circle breaker\n",
    "she was very strong\n",
    "once she had hold of you she was so gentle and good at first she would surprise you\n",
    "she looked around with a soft pink look on her face in a minute it was a daring look and the next minute she would try to break your finger bones\n",
    "she liked to change a circle into crack the whip and with a jerk of her arm she could over\n",
    "they played running water still pond fox in the morning geese in the evening and then hide and seek\n",
    "once lady clare was it because she was carrying a little chinese paper fan that folded back on tiny sticks then shelley was it again\n",
    "laura ran to her best hiding place down on the ground behind the woodpile in the back yard\n",
    "she waited a long time crouched over and nobody came to find her\n",
    "from where she hid she could see the back of the house hear the negroes and upstairs on the long sleeping porch she could see uncle george walking up and down up and down smoking his pipe\n",
    "she listened to the dark dense rustling of the fig trees and once she put a straw down a and said the incantation in a very low voice then she saw maureen running by and maureen saw her\n",
    "with a leap maureen was up on her woodpile\n",
    "she did not and then after a strange pause as if she could think she pushed the whole of the piled logs down on laura upsetting herself too\n",
    "choo choo said maureen and then she ran away\n",
    "laura at first was surprised and then with great effort she began to extricate herself\n",
    "the surprise the heavy weight and the getting out kept her so busy that at first she did not miss them coming to look for her\n",
    "she had on her next best white dress and long tears showed in it and long scratches marked up her legs and arms\n",
    "she had the taste of bark in her mouth and kept spitting on the ground though the taste was still there\n",
    "insidethe house the light tinkling sounds went on roxie s high laugh like a dove cry rose softly and hung over the yard\n",
    "and from farther away the sigh of the compress reminded her of dabney who had gone somewhere\n",
    "harm that was what speechless gaze\n",
    "that was what made her stay so close to them all what drove her flying over the house over the fields that way after the others\n",
    "that was what put extra her mouth\n",
    "it was the harm inside her\n",
    "she likes to spoil things india had explained matter of factly and matter of factly laura had accepted it\n",
    "but the cousins were a clan\n",
    "they all said things and they all kissed one another and yet they all had secret despiting ways to happiness\n",
    "at hide trick could be played on laura for she was still outside\n",
    "she herself would never mean from the start to push down and overwhelm or withhold any secret intention or hope in relish and delight\n",
    "i 1\n",
    "pushing the heavy logs from her she felt shorn of pleasure in her cousins and angry in not having known that this was how the fairchilds wanted things to be and how they would make things be when it pleased them she thought she heard shelley laughing and calling his name down in the house\n",
    "a feeling of their unawareness of her came over laura and crushed her more heavily than the harm of maureen 5and the logs of wood and she thought surely her mother would cry in heaven to see her now if she had not cried so far\n",
    "she licked the blood away clean from her arms and looked at her knees to see if some old scabs had come off yes\n",
    "she was as black and ugly as a little negro\n",
    "she tied her sash tight around her hips\n",
    "without looking up she crept around the yard with her locket in her mouth around the cistern on her hands and knees keeping low not to be seen her feet dragging numbly\n",
    "under the snowball bush she hit both feet with her fists until she could feel the sting and then picking all the cinders one by one out of her elbows and skirt and out of her roman sandals she walked was the trunk of a tree without being caught\n",
    "at that moment touching home her finger to the tree she was not happy not unhappy\n",
    "free\n",
    "she called looking around not seeing the others anywhere but she had them every one her head\n",
    "then she saw uncle george walk out of the house and stare out into the late day\n",
    "she wanted to call out to him but somethingwould not let her\n",
    "something told her ever since the look he gave her that it was right for him to stand apart and that when he opened an envelope in a room no one should enter\n",
    "now she felt matter of factly intimate with it with his stand and his predicament\n",
    "she thought of herself as growing up beside uncle george the way some little flowers and vines have picked their tree and so she felt herself sure of being near him\n",
    "she knew quite objectively that he would not disown her and uproot her that she felt inner warnings that this was a miracle of safety strange in any house and in her this miracle was guarded from the contamination even of thinking\n",
    "as if by smell by the smell of his pipe she knew that he out of all the delta fairchilds had kindness and that it was more than an acting in kindness it was a waiting a withholding as if he could see a fire or a light when he saw a human being regardless of who it was kin or not even aunt ellen to whom he called and waved now and had never done the first thing in his life to dim it\n",
    "this made him seem young as young as she\n",
    "on the other hand when all night she could hear coming up the dark stair well his voice soft and loud with uncle battle s bark after it chasing she gathered that he was hard to please in some things and therefore old\n",
    "uncle george and uncle battle would for roxie or ernest to come up to the house and fix them their nightcaps\n",
    "she stored love for uncle george fiercely in her heart she wished shellmound would burn down and she could run in and rescue him she prayed for god to bless him for she felt they all crowded him so the cousins rushed in on him so they smiled at him too much inviting too much daring him not to be faultless and she would have liked to clear them away give him room and then what\n",
    "she would let him be mean and horrible horrible to the horrible world\n",
    "would she\n",
    "she leaned her forehead against the tree with some shimmering design about him in her head coming like a dream in which she was clinging protecting fighting all in one a fairchild flourishing and flailing her arms about\n",
    "of course it was all one thing it was one feeling\n",
    "it was need\n",
    "need pulled you out of bed in into it then sang you to sleep at night as your mother did need sent you dreams\n",
    "need did all this when would it explain\n",
    "oh some day\n",
    "she waited now and then each night fell asleep in the vise of india s arms\n",
    "she imagined that one day maybe the next in the fairchild house she would know the answer to the heart s pull just as it would come to her in school why the apple was pulled down on newton s head and that it was the way for girls in the world that they should be put off put off put off and told a little later but told surely\n",
    "uncle george came down the steps and walked slowly over the fresh cut grass not seeing her for she was behind the big pecan tree\n",
    "all his secret or his problem or what was in the blue letter though she did not know what it was was sharp to her to see him and perhaps as filled with dreaded life as a seashell she had once come on on the seashore and unwittingly seized\n",
    "do n t cry out here laura said a soft voice\n",
    "it was little battle in his overalls\n",
    "he poked a cold biscuit with a little ham in it into her mouth and because she was startled stood by while she swallowed it\n",
    "then they ran into the house\n",
    "oh little battle\n",
    "laura wanted so badly to be taken to their hearts never wondering if she had not been at any time before her own wish that she almost knew what the fairchilds were like what to expect but her wish was steadier than her vision and that itself kept her from knowing\n",
    "ellen saw it\n",
    "while she held supper for dabney late now at some bridesmaid sparty ellen had walked out in the yard to feel the cool\n",
    "it was first dark and the thrushes were singing tirelessly from the trees\n",
    "she had walked was gathering in the curtains past the flower beds down toward the bayou\n",
    "the evening was hot it was the fragrance of the lemon lilies that was cool like the breath from a mountain well\n",
    "from the house came a momentary discord on the piano keys\n",
    "that was shelley passing through the music room putting her hands down over mary lamar mackey s\n",
    "then the slow dwelling melody went on\n",
    "ellen looked down the road for dabney\n",
    "stretching away the cotton fields slowly emptying were becoming the color of the sky a deepening blue so intense that it was like darkness itself\n",
    "there was a feeling in the infinity of the delta that even the bounded things waiting for instance could go on forever\n",
    "over and over from the bayou woods came the one high note then the three low notes of the dove\n",
    "at her feet the bayou ran low long since cleared of trees here and all but motionless\n",
    "she thought it reflecting very much but an entity in itself\n",
    "she remembered old disparaging partheny when she got to her going so ill advised on foot\n",
    "in partheny s house in had bent over the cot where the old woman lay out straight with her long toes pointing up and her eyes looking at the ceiling\n",
    "partheny do you hear me\n",
    "are you in a spell partheny\n",
    "partheny was her nurse when her oldest children were little\n",
    "oh i done had it partheny had said\n",
    "it over by this time\n",
    "w i were mindless miss ellen\n",
    "i were out of my house\n",
    "i were de river\n",
    "i were standing on yazoo bridge wid dis foot lifted\n",
    "i were mindless did n t know my name or name of my sons\n",
    "hand stop me\n",
    "mr troy flavin he were by my side gallopin on de bridge\n",
    "he laugh at me good old partheny\n",
    "do n t you jump in dat no sir no sir i ai n t goin to do dat\n",
    "guides me home\n",
    "you can go on back now go on back miss ellen to your little girl puttin on her weddin veil\n",
    "but do n t set your heels down\n",
    "go real still\n",
    "she heard someone coming from the house and saw from the glimmer of white clothes and the tall strolling walk of company that it was george he waved briefly\n",
    "he looked thin\n",
    "poor boy he had not even eaten any to speak of of the good coconut cake she tried to tempt him with\n",
    "the noise of the children made him bite his lip and he did not like mary lamar mackey this time\n",
    "she had not even taken her apron off she clasped her hands before her\n",
    "but he untied the apron when he came and threw it over the branches of a little dogwood tree\n",
    "forget everything out here he said runaway girl in the bayou woods george she said a white girl\n",
    "going just as fast to memphis as she could go\n",
    "purely loitering\n",
    "i saw her peeping out from behind a tree the prettiest thing ever made\n",
    "i very ill advisedly went to foot by the short cut\n",
    "there she was\n",
    "she had never thought of mentioning the girl or seeing her\n",
    "battle would say ellen fairchild do you mean to tell me you ve been out alone a lone woman on foot in these fields and woods\n",
    "no gun either i bet you all i ve got\n",
    "but she was tired and sometimes now the whole world seemed rampant running away from her and she would always be carrying another child to bring into it\n",
    "now she saw by the dense evening light for she always knew it when she saw it a look on george s face that both endeared him to her and reminded her the first source of the feeling long ago might have been that look she did not know\n",
    "it was only a tender change of countenance a smile but it looked like the vanishing of suspense\n",
    "there was gratification and regret in it at something you said\n",
    "it was as if he had known life could not go on without this thing now like a crash a fall it had come\n",
    "so you having begun without knowing it some unfinished story to him would then tell everything perhaps\n",
    "she never altogether understood george s abrupt tender smile yet without thinking she would often find herself telling the very thing that brought it to his face\n",
    "it could not be amusement for she had nothing funny about her not a bone in her body\n",
    "for instance now surely he could not be simply enjoying the idea of herself brought up against a wild runaway girl\n",
    "for her heart still felt the strain\n",
    "and certainly she to run away\n",
    "not far from here at all she said\n",
    "she was asking the way to the public road\n",
    "he said at once yes i met her as i was coming in\n",
    "then she was speechless\n",
    "it was a thing she had never learned in her life to expect that what has come to you come in dignity to yourself in loneliness will yet be shared the secret never intact\n",
    "she gazed into the evening star her lips unreasonably pressed together\n",
    "and did she ask the way to the memphis road\n",
    "she asked then\n",
    "yes and i took her over to the old argyle gin and slept with her ellen said george\n",
    "she seemed to let go in her whole body and stood languidly still under her star a moment then pulled her apron where it still shone white in the dogwood tree and tried to tie it back on\n",
    "george made an impatient sound would say a deliberate wounding thing as if in assurancethat nothing further might then hurt you\n",
    "it was always some fact all true about himself just a part of the fact which was the same as a wild free kind of self assertion it was his pride too speaking out\n",
    "then impatiently as if you were too close to a fire he pulled you away from your pain\n",
    "she s older than you thought he said\n",
    "his voice distressed her by sounding grateful to her was it simply because she had neither flinched nor disbelieved him or said it amounts to nothing like a fairchild quick to comfort\n",
    "she glanced toward george though she could no longer see him\n",
    "a feeling of uncontrollable melancholy came over her to see him in this half light which had so rested her before he came out\n",
    "dear george whose every act could verge so closely on throwing himself away what on earth would ever be worth that that was reflected back on him from all passing things\n",
    "oh george\n",
    "she cried and then sometimes i m so dabney marries she wo n t be happy in her life\n",
    "r r\n",
    "he patted her arm yet not heavily or trying to turn her around\n",
    "well let s go in she said\n",
    "yet she lingered a little breeze seemed to stir over the bayou and she was refreshed\n",
    "george was the one person she knew in the world who did not have it in him to make of any act a facile thing or to make a travesty out of human beings even in spite of temptation at a time like this moment of himself as one human being\n",
    "how the fairchilds did talk on about their amazing shortcomings with an irony that she could not follow at all and never rested in perfecting caricatures little soulless images of themselves and each other that could not be surprised or were first married had told her something like this\n",
    "only george left the world she knew as pure in spite of his fierce energies even heresies as he found it still real still bad still fleeting and mysteriousand hopelessly alluring to her\n",
    "she had feared for the whole family somehow at a time like this being their mother and the atmosphere heavy with the wedding and festivities hanging over their heads when this girl that was at first so ambiguous and so lovely even to her all dull and tired when she touched at their life ran through their woods\n",
    "she had not had a chance to face this fear before for at the time she had had to cope with the runaway girl herself who was only the age of her daughter dabney so she had believed\n",
    "but at last she was standing quietly in the long twilight with george bitterly glad now it was certain he was not happy that he as if she had been thrown at them for now was it not over\n",
    "aware of his touch on her tired arm for he was seldom in the way the others were demonstrative she felt that he was in reality not intimate with this houseful at all and that they did not know it for a moment she thought she saw how it was\n",
    "all around them the lightning bugs had flashed to life\n",
    "they flew slowly and near the earth just beyond the reach now of india s hand\n",
    "ellen\n",
    "battle called out first from the window then from the door\n",
    "oh ellen here s troy\n",
    "he s come up to supper\n",
    "ellen\n",
    "it s time to go in ellen said\n",
    "dabney will be coming home and looking everywhere for her mother\n",
    "she knew she had provoked that smile again in the blurred profile she looked into as they started up the garden\n",
    "but grass and breathed and sighed expectantly in the dark as if before they reached the light and confusion of the house she could tell something gentle to him\n",
    "look george said\n",
    "ranny was at their feet in the grass asleep worn out lying astride a stalk of sugar cane\n",
    "george took him up without waking him and carried him\n",
    "he s gained\n",
    "he weighs thirty six pounds\n",
    "presently ranny stirred said something and george set him down\n",
    "balancing and complaining like an old drunken man for a moment he went forward on his own feet\n",
    "what did he say\n",
    "ellen asked\n",
    "he said do n t hold me\n",
    "ranny who always until now wanted dearly to be held walked straight forward and they sighed in amusement drawing together to see the little figure going in front of them then beginning lightly blindly to trot riding the horse of his mind in time in the room with troy waiting for her sister she excused herself to dress for the clarksdale dance\n",
    "but up in her room in her teddies she sat down on her cedar chest and unlocked her trip abroad diary lit a fatima cigarette and began to write\n",
    "she had turned the floor fan on her back and seat and behind her as she wrote the two ends of her little satin sash were dancing straight out\n",
    "laura with her nightgown on stood in the door watching her\n",
    "in shelley s room the best front one there were medallions on the wallpaper each a gold frame with a face inside which laura had thought were grandfathers and grandmothers probably from port gibson until shelley had told her they were n t anybody which was much more mysterious\n",
    "the wastebasket shelley had woven in crafts her summer at camp\n",
    "her bureau was decorated with a tray and powder box and jar set from her dabney grandmother\n",
    "the jars she had filled with rose leaves then but not often she still took the stoppers out and smelled their last year s perfume\n",
    "the mirror on the side arm of which her curling irons hung like a telephone was stuck all around with snapshots taken mostly on a trip with mary denis summers and some yankees to the west at which she had had the worst time she ever had away from home she could not tell you why she kept their pictures snooty faces against dim yawning streaks of the grand canyon daily in view\n",
    "her silver comb and brush set had on them aunt ellen s the initials intertwined with raised lilies of the valley and the bristles worn curved as a thin shell now luckily nobody brushed their hair any more\n",
    "her jewelry was inside a little box aunt shannon before she was so mixed up had given her it was a present from her great uncle denis who had sent it to her the year she was born from off in the mexican it\n",
    "inside were a pair of her mother s gold bracelets with chains a silver butterfly ring from the western trip her camp ring one of uncle george s cuff links she had found when little and had kept her great grandmother mary shannon s black cameos earrings and pin and her seed pearl comb and two or three diamond rings\n",
    "shelley would not be caught dead wearing any of them\n",
    "she liked a garnet brooch of her mother s to pin her middy blouse together but now she could not find it shelley said dabney had probably borrowed it it was dabney who lost everything or maybe india who could dress herself up like a savage this summer scavenging from room to room\n",
    "in the cedar chest underneath her now lay all the underclothes she had received for graduation presents from high school and college in virginia some in little silk sacheted purses made to keep them in until she got married\n",
    "there was one gown aunt made it chiffon with a little peach chiffon coat that had a train every edge picoted and then embroidered all around with lover s knots it was transparent\n",
    "shelley s mantel was wood and white marble and the hearth was round and raised in a fat apron\n",
    "the fireplace was now hidden by a perfectly square silk screen painted by aunt tempe with a bayou floating with wild ducks at sunset a line of the ducks was rising at a right angle from the water and went straight to the upper corner like an arrow\n",
    "on her mantel shelf was a gold china slipper a souvenir of mary denis summers s wedding holding matches and that was all except for an incense burner and a photograph of shelley in a spanish comb and a great deal of piled hair taken the year she graduated from fairchilds high school\n",
    "shelley hated it\n",
    "on the washstand was shelley s glass with three stolen late blooming cape jessamines from miss parnell dortch s yard now turned bright gold from virginia a high square cool one with a mosquito net over it and a trundle bed underneath it\n",
    "as a baby shelley had slept on that near her mother and she despised having it still under her bed\n",
    "there was no way on earth shelley could get a lamp brought in to read by in bed\n",
    "a long brass pole dangled from the center of the ceiling ending in two brass lilies from each of which a long naked but weak light bulb stuck out\n",
    "plenty light to dress by and you can read in the lower part of the house with your clothes on like other people uncle battle said favoring dabney as he did and she never read not having time\n",
    "a paper kewpie doll batted about on a thread tied to the chandelier that was all it was good for\n",
    "shelley wanted to read the beautiful and damned which was going around the delta and to read it in bed but she was about to give up hope to write\n",
    "in her closet were mostly evening dresses but enough middy blouses and pleated skirts hung at one end\n",
    "all her shoes were flung in a heap on the floor as if in despair\n",
    "one green king tut sandal was out in the middle of the room\n",
    "her peach ostrich mules were on her feet and as she wrote she from time to time lifted up her bare heels and waited a moment tensely before going on like a mockingbird stretching in the grass\n",
    "momently she put her fatima cigarette ashes in her hair receiver\n",
    "go away laura\n",
    "said shelley\n",
    "you are n t supposed to watch us every minute\n",
    "laura ran off having the grace not to stick out her as india would do\n",
    "shelley was to go to europe after the wedding with aunt tempe it was aunt tempe s graduation present but she could not bring herself to wait that long before beginning to write in the book with the lock and key we all went fishing with papa in moon lake caught 103 fish home in time dance\n",
    "pee wee prentiss\n",
    "stomach ache\n",
    "dabney s favorite word is perfect\n",
    "but already so soon she was writing long entries\n",
    "dressing a moment they were callingher downstairs and writing a moment jumping up and down she succeeded in getting the tulle dress still hot from the iron over her head and in filling in almost six pages of the diary\n",
    "her chest rose and fell in the little starlight blue dress flat as a bathing suit against her heart\n",
    "tonight again d was cruel to t f\n",
    "and is keeping him waiting and then going out to one last dance\n",
    "t does not go home waits for just a glimpse\n",
    "he is interested because he thinks she must be smart\n",
    "to provoke a man like him\n",
    "dabney does not even know it\n",
    "why does n t it dawn on t f\n",
    "that none of the fairchilds now and then one of us is gifted aunt j a\n",
    "says i am gifted at tennis for no reason\n",
    "we never wanted to be smart one by one but all together we have a wall we are self sufficient against people that come up knocking we are solid to the outside\n",
    "does the world suspect\n",
    "that we are all very private people\n",
    "i think one by one we re all more lonely than private and more lonely than self sufficient\n",
    "i think uncle g takes us one by one\n",
    "that is love i think\n",
    "he takes us one by one but papa takes us all together and loves us by the bunch which makes him a more cheerful man\n",
    "maybe we come too fast for papa\n",
    "one by one we get it from mashula and laura allen and we can be got at hurt killed loved the same way as things get to us\n",
    "all the more us poor people to be cherished\n",
    "i feel a bunch separately but not one to go unloved for the other loved\n",
    "in the world i mean\n",
    "shellmound and the world\n",
    "mamma says shame that we forget about laura and we loved her mother so much we never mention her name or we would all cry\n",
    "we are all unfair people\n",
    "we are such sweet people to be so spoiled\n",
    "george spoils us does not reproach us praises us even for what he feels is weak in us\n",
    "maybe i can tell him yet that i know where robbie is but so far i ca n t\n",
    "the moment of telling i can not bring myself to that\n",
    "i thought it would be easy at the supper table but in the middle of supper now we all look at each other all wondering before a thing like dabney s wedding not knowing just what to do\n",
    "sometimes i believe we live most privately just when things are most crowded like in the delta like do about anybody in the world because it seems like you ought to do it soon or it will be too late\n",
    "i may not put any more in my diary at all till after the wedding\n",
    "i wish now it would happen and be past i hate days fateful days\n",
    "i heard papa talking about me to uncle g without knowing i was running by the library door not to meet t when he came in but waiting i did and papa said i was the next one to worry about i was prissy priggish\n",
    "uncle g said nobody could be born that way they had to get humiliated\n",
    "can you be humiliated without knowing it\n",
    "i would know it\n",
    "he said i was not priggish i only liked to resist\n",
    "so does dabney like it i know\n",
    "so does anybody but india and young children\n",
    "when t proposed to d i think it was just because she was already so spoiled he had to did\n",
    "that is not the way i want it done to me\n",
    "nobody tells t a thing yet and maybe we will never tell him anything\n",
    "but i think he never minds at all\n",
    "i think t likes to size things up\n",
    "i would never love him\n",
    "i think he could tell tonight that uncle g has something on his mind those sweet worry lines across his brow and eyes drinking all papa s bounce because t is the one who is always thinking of ways in or ways out and i think he gets the smell of someone studying as if it were one of the animals in trouble\n",
    "trouble acts up he puts it down\n",
    "but i know trouble is not something fresh you never saw before that is coming just the one time but is old and your old enough to die yet can remember little hurts for sixty years just like the big hurts you know now having your sister walk into something you dread and you can at a family that cherishes its weaknesses and belittles its strength\n",
    "he is from the mountains very slow\n",
    "where is his mother\n",
    "father\n",
    "he is not a born gambler of any description\n",
    "he considers d not anything he is taking a chance on but a sure thing and wants her for sure\n",
    "robbie is another person like that and wants george for sure\n",
    "i ca n t stand her\n",
    "maybe europe will change everything\n",
    "when i see the leaning tower of pisa will i like robbie any better\n",
    "i doubt it\n",
    "aunt t will be with me all the time\n",
    "all of us wish g did not want her and tell him and tell him she is not worthy to wipe his feet\n",
    "but he does want her and suffers\n",
    "he goes on\n",
    "i do not know and can not think how it was when papa and mama wanted each other\n",
    "of course they do n t now and do n t suffer by now\n",
    "i can not think of any just speak to the world\n",
    "papa and mama do not fight the world\n",
    "they have let it in\n",
    "did they ever even lock a door\n",
    "so much life and confusion has got in that there is nothing to stop it running over like the magic pudding pot\n",
    "the whole delta is in and out of this house\n",
    "life may be stronger than papa is\n",
    "he let troy in and look troy took dabney\n",
    "life is stronger than george but george was not surprised only he wants robbie reid\n",
    "life surprises papa and it is papa that surprise hurts\n",
    "i think g expects things to amount to more than you and so do i this scares me in the middle of a dance\n",
    "uncle g scares me a little for knowing my fright\n",
    "papa is ashamed of it but g does not reproach me i think he upholds it\n",
    "he expects things to be more than you think and to mean something something he cherishes our weaknesses because come to us\n",
    "i think when you are strong you can squeeze them back and hold them from you a little while but where you are weak you run to meet them\n",
    "shelley with a sigh leaned out of her window to rest\n",
    "a calling down in the bayou somewhere and the hiss of the compress came softly and regularly as the sighing breath of night\n",
    "she heard voices on the lawn\n",
    "dabney in a filmy dress was telling troy good night\n",
    "shelley listened how well she could hear and see from here she had not before realized or tried out\n",
    "oh i wish i did n t have to go to the old dance or that you could dance troy\n",
    "cried dabney\n",
    "she clung to him her voice troubled and tender\n",
    "never mind we ll soon be married\n",
    "sure said troy\n",
    "she clung to him more as if she would be torn away and looked over her shoulder at the night as seemed to shelley to be trembling with the fluctuation of starlight as with the pulsing of the compress on the river\n",
    "troy patted dabney s shoulder\n",
    "i hear your heart she said right out as if imploringly and yet to comfort him\n",
    "i ll see you tomorrow he said\n",
    "take care of yourself she said\n",
    "i will\n",
    "it wo n t be long until i can take care of you\n",
    "there were tears in shelley s eyes their tenderness was almost pity as they clung together\n",
    "she nearly cried with them\n",
    "i have to go now troy i have to\n",
    "she stood away\n",
    "he stood with his arms hanging and she went\n",
    "dickie boy featherstone put her in his open top car\n",
    "then shelley heard uncle george walk heavily over the porch and down the steps\n",
    "she saw him strolling toward the gate and smelled his pipe\n",
    "george\n",
    "he looked up and said how could not say anything she could not call it out a window\n",
    "it would seem so conceited of her too\n",
    "she believed he went and stood on the bank of the bayou to smoke she could see a patch of white through the spanish daggers though the mist drifted there now turning like foam in the luminous night\n",
    "she leaned her forehead on the wall the warm wallpaper pressed her head like a hand\n",
    "the scene on the trestle was so familiar as to be almost shelley s head for her memory arrested the action and let her see it again and again like a painting in a schoolroom with colors vivid and thunderclouded george and maureen above locked together and the others below with the shadow of the trestle on them\n",
    "the engine with two wings of smoke above it soft as a big bird was upon them coming as it would\n",
    "george was no longer working at maureen s caught foot\n",
    "their faces fixed and to wait for the blow\n",
    "maureen s arms had spread across the path of the engine\n",
    "shelley knew what had happened next but the greatest pressure of uneasiness let her go after the one moment as if the rest were a feat a trick that would not work twice\n",
    "the engine came to a stop\n",
    "the tumbling denouement was what made them all laugh at the table\n",
    "the apology of the engineer old sleepy head mr doolittle that traded at the store\n",
    "shelley beat her head a time or two on the wall\n",
    "and maureen with no warning pushed with both her strong hands on george s chest and he went over fall from the trestle fall down in the vines to little ranny s and old sylvanus wild cries\n",
    "george did not even yet let her go his hand reached for her pummeling hand and what he could not accomplish by loosening her foot or by pulling her up free he accomplished by falling himself\n",
    "wrenched bodily her heavy foot time the dog had stopped and mr doolittle was looking from his little cab saying he was sorry mr fairchild\n",
    "but george sat on the ground simply looking at maureen\n",
    "she had leaped up with alacrity a taunting abandon which seemed to hypnotize him\n",
    "she leaped up and down on first one foot and then the other lip\n",
    "there were things in that afternoon which gave shelley an un easiness she seemed to feel all alone so that she hoarded the story even more closely to herself would not tell it and from night to night hesitated to put it down in her diary though she looked forward to it all day\n",
    "to begin with there was the oblivious she had led them all in walking too fast for robbie in her high heels a tomboy was only what she used to be and was n t now all day sunday fishing and all she had done it\n",
    "of course robbie would wear the wrong heels dressed the wrong way and should have to keep taking little runs to catch up and finally be left as haughty as possible at the approach of a trestle\n",
    "but then came shelley s own shame in not being able to walk the trestle herself\n",
    "no one would ever forget that about her all their lives\n",
    "she thought herself that it must have been premonition with uncle george along something was bound to happen it was his told her to hold back\n",
    "then there was the terror with which the engine filled her that poky familiar thing it was sure to stop of course she had no born terror of the yellow dog\n",
    "maureen s assumption that she could stop it by holding both her arms out across its path was more logical than you thought at first\n",
    "but shelley s deepest uneasiness came from robbie s first words you did n t do this for me\n",
    "in her fury robbie rose straight up as untouchable foolish heels and all\n",
    "and how george had looked at her\n",
    "certainly he thinks nothing of danger none of us ever has her father had told robbie later when at the supper table she came to tears\n",
    "but shelley felt that george and robbie had hurt each other in a way so deep so unyielding that she was unequal to understanding it yet\n",
    "she hoped to grasp it all the worst but fiercely feeling herself a young unmarried unengaged girl she held the more triumphantly to her secret guess that this confrontation on the trestle was itself the reason for robbie s leaving george and for his not going after her\n",
    "the guess made even his presence at dabney s wedding take on the cast of assertion here he was not looking for his wife\n",
    "but dabney felt nothing of this she felt no more about that black moment since she saw it was not fatal when the engine stopped a hair s breadth from george and little dance step with herself\n",
    "after the train passed dabney and troy had simply gone on up the railroad track and got engaged\n",
    "was it possible that it was because of something strong george had felt that the way a stroke of lightning can blaze a tree she could not forget that happening\n",
    "extravagantly responsible just as he was extravagantly reckless what had he been prepared for how many times before had something come very near to them and stopped\n",
    "dabney if she knew would tell george in a minute that robbie was no farther away than fairchild s store this day hiding from him and crying for him\n",
    "but she could not enlighten him\n",
    "she and robbie had seen each other across the crowded room a of long handled popcorn poppers turned gently between them to block their vision and both their faces her crying one too went fixed the way it was in high school they did not speak\n",
    "she could hear under her window now the faint sound of the the by the light of the stars and then the dancers catching their breaths\n",
    "shelley shelley\n",
    "are you ever coming\n",
    "called mary lamar mackey\n",
    "then shelley put a little coat of peach silk around her and went down where at the foot of the stairs piggy was waiting for her shouting up i m the sheik of araby\n",
    "much later in her room dabney opened her eyes\n",
    "perhaps she had only just gone to sleep but the silver night woke her the night so deep advanced toward day that she seemed to breathe in a well drenched with the whiteness of an hour that astonished her\n",
    "it hurt her to lift her hand and touch at her forehead for all seemed to be tenderness now the night like herself breathless and yet serene unlooked on\n",
    "the daring of morning light impending would have to strike her when it reached her not yet\n",
    "the window invited her to see her window like a sleeping moth clung to the chair and the whole leafy structure of the outside seemed agitated and rustled the shadows darted like birds\n",
    "the gigantic sky radiant as water ran over the earth and around it\n",
    "the old moon in the west and the planets of morning streamed their light\n",
    "she wondered if she would ever know\n",
    "the constellations\n",
    "the birds all slept\n",
    "the mourning dove that cried the latest must sleep the deepest of all\n",
    "what could she know now\n",
    "but she could see a single leaf on a willow tree as far as the bayou s edge such clarity as there was in everything the cotton like the rolling breath of sleep overflowed the fields\n",
    "out into it if she were married she would walk now her bare foot touch at the night s hour firmly too a woman s serious foot\n",
    "she would walk on the clear night angels though did that tread it with love not foot would offer the roof the chimney the window of her husband the solid house\n",
    "draw me in she whispered draw me in open the window like my window i am still only looking in where it is dark papa uncle george gave me a walking horse red with four white socks and a star here\n",
    "well you did n t cry about that did you\n",
    "said battle\n",
    "she s going to ride me\n",
    "said ranny\n",
    "none of this is going to do you any good that i can see dabney said battle across the river\n",
    "i do n t know whether to give you an airplane or build you a bridge\n",
    "i know a way she could come back home from marmion said ranny\n",
    "if she goes down the other side of the river to the bridge at fairchilds and goes across and comes up this side she could come home\n",
    "battle lifting him up and throwing him to the ceiling\n",
    "you think you can show way home do you\n",
    "no sir dabney s going away from us and never coming back\n",
    "ranny burst into tears in the air and so did bluet out in the hall\n",
    "battle set the boy down in haste\n",
    "ranny\n",
    "said shelley looking up from her book\n",
    "papa was joking\n",
    "papa was only joking\n",
    "dabney will come back whenever you call her ranny\n",
    "oh papa\n",
    "stop crying ranny said battle shortly\n",
    "bluet can cry her eyes out if she wants to because she s a girl but you ca n t or i ll take the switch to you promptly\n",

    "they were only procrastinating about it\n",
    "but here dabney was marrying and still the high shabby old rooms went unchanged for funerals with rocking chairs in them little knickknacks and playthings and treasures all shaken mantel would probably stay right there through the ceremony\n",
    "on the table before her now a tinker toy windmill was sitting up and running with the wedding two days off right next to the exquisite tumbler with the young pretender engraved on it that was her wedding present to battle and ellen cracked now and carelessly stuffed with a bouquet that could have been picked and put there by nobody but bluet black eyed susans a little chewed rose and a four o clock\n",
    "aunt tempe closed her eyes to see mashula s dulcimer still hanging by that thin ribbon on the wall did she know shelley could take it down and play juanita on it\n",
    "india followed her gaze it passed fleetingly over uncle pinck s coin collection from around the world that aunt tempe had been tired of looking at in inverness and taking out of little shannon s mouth and fell sadly on the guns that stood in the corner by the door and the pistols that rested on a little gilt and marble she murmured freshly distressed at their very thought as if in her sensitive hearing she could hear them all go off at once\n",
    "that was somebody s gun he had killed twelve bears every saturday with it\n",

    "india sat down and looked up at it\n",
    "they danced out and laura at the tail end would have danced her way upstairs too dancing as if she were going to be in the wedding\n",

    "her tingling feet were dancing but her body held her still in place at a blind alley of desperation as paralyzed from escape as a rabbit in sudden light\n",
    "it was the last thing she would have thought of to pity aunt ellen or uncle george at shellmound or to pity maureen just going around the turn of the stairs dancing so sweetly today without fighting or to pity dabney who would always kiss just as quick as she saw\n",
    "where could she go just to hold out her arms and be taken quickly what other way dark out of sight of what was here and going by\n",
    "she suddenly considered snatching roxie s cake and running out the back she waltzed in a even hate danced so sweetly just at the last minute going around the turn they made her despair\n",
    "she felt she could never be able to hate anybody that hurt her in secret and in confidence and that she was maureen s secret the way maureen was hers\n",

    "there was silence everywhere at shellmound prompt as india s gasps of half distress half delight then only lady clare s wistful complaint i do n t know how to ever end it\n",
    "wide eyed roxie suddenly reached for howard s little boy s hand and he yielding george the fish they bolted\n",
    "where the clamor had been uncle george s two words shot out like one bird then beat about the walls struck laura who could not stop even then shuffling her foot moved helplesslyup and down in one place wondering if uncle george would kill her\n",
    "poor aunt primrose who would not hurt any thing on earth appeared blinking at the library door holding her little lace mit nearly finished before her breast\n",
    "presently dabney s light excited laugh floated back at them from above and then her face bright and mischievous under the sparkling hair looked smiling down over the rail as if disembodied\n",
    "aunt ellen looked up at her a minute and then said dabney you re supposed to be in greenwood getting the groceries dear and walked serenely toward the parlor uncle george his burned face still shining came past laura and she felt that she would turn to stone but his fishy tobacco y hand came down ever so gently over her hair and she stopped tempe s voice rose\n",

    "you knew what\n",

    "you did get here\n",
    "she said to aunt tempe in that warm marveling voice with which she always welcomed people no matter how late she was doing it as if some planet had mysteriously entered a fresh orbit and appeared at shellmound\n",
    "she kissed aunt tempe s cheek the softest cheek of the fairchilds which aunt tempe offered in a temporary manner like a very expensive possession\n",
    "after all india could read her mind as aunt tempe kissed back she had been invited over long distance telephone and she had been only barely able to make out what one bolt from the blue was that dabney was engaged and then it was very 25 1255 toolong they had let bluet tell her the wedding day\n",

    "dabney who loved her father and adored george it like a fact of the weather that it was denis and be denis that they gave the family honor to\n",
    "she held troy s hand under the table and accepted it with a feeling not far from luxuriousness was the one that looked like a greek god denis who squandered away his life loving people too much was too kind to his family was torn to pieces by other people s misfortune married beneath him threw himself away in drink got himself killed in the war\n",
    "it was denis who gambled the highest who fell the hardest when thrown by the most who was the most delirious in his fevers who went the farthest on his travels who was the most beset\n",

    "it was a shame on earth that maureen though george would naturally risk his life for her was the only remnant of his body she bore no more breath of resemblance to him than she did to as aunt if anything she took after her mother though her hair was light\n",

    "poor denis\n",
    "she thought all at once while maureen eyeing her stuck out her tongue through her smiling and fruit filled mouth it was morning the day of the rehearsal\n",
    "roy ran out of the house him from her window his face tender eyed under the blocky serious forehead and the light slept on hair pushed to the side with a darker shadow the size of a guinea egg under the crest\n",
    "alone in the yard he said something to a bird\n",
    "this was her last day with her daughter dabney before she married\n",
    "how she loved her sons though\n",
    "this is dabney s wedding rehearsal day ellen said turning to the old great aunts with roxie by her offering them a second cup of black coffee while breakfast was getting ready\n",
    "gordon dear i m hot said aunt shannon fretfully\n",
    "she lay back with her soft black mary jane slippers crossed on aunt mac s chaise longue frowning slightly at the mounted blue the wall\n",
    "she thinks none of the rest of us know it s september growled aunt mac\n",
    "she snapped her watch onto her bosom\n",
    "nobody but brother gordon killed in the battle of shiloh\n",
    "foot had never been except for a little while when battle s generation were growing up and absorbing their time and in recent years the belief on aunt shannon s part that she was conversing with people whom aunt mac knew well to be dead seemed a freer development of the schism\n",
    "far back in civil war days ellen had been told or had gathered some ineradicable coolness had come between them it seemed to have sprung from a jealousy between the sisters over which one agonized the more or the more abandonedly over the fighting brothers and husbands\n",
    "with the brothers and hus bands every man killed in the end the jealousy did not seem death but extended by it memory of fear and the keepingup of loyalty had its rivalries too made them endless and now wholly desperate for no good was ever to come of anguish any more and so it never had when anguish was fresh\n",
    "aunt shannon now with her access to their soldier brothers battle george and gordon the duel to her husband lucian miles and even to aunt mac s husband duncan laws was dwelling without shame in happiness and superiority over her sister\n",
    "poor aunt mac did indeed seem to think less of her husband now in spite of herself she made little flung off remarks about his family columbus new corners when aunt shannon spoke casually to duncan dearie and bent her head as if he had come up behind her while she was knitting to give her a little kiss on the back of the neck as indeed he had done often long ago\n",
    "the wedding s right here\n",
    "are we ready aunt mac\n",
    "duncan dearie there s a scrap of nuisance around here ought to be shot said aunt shannon glancing sideways without stirring\n",
    "you ll see him\n",

    "coming\n",
    "duncan laws will shoot who i tell him thank you said aunt mac your time so mixed up\n",
    "vainest of the fairchilds\n",
    "well then ellen go on to dabney\n",
    "wake her up\n",
    "but dabney had ridden out on her red filly before any of them were awake out through the early fields\n",
    "vi let had not yet swept the night cobwebs from the doors and she had dashed through shuddering with fighting hands and pushed open the back gate into the early eastern light which already felt warm and lapping against her face and arms\n",
    "in her stall the little filly looked at her as if she were waiting for her early there was a tremor to go in her neck and side\n",
    "howard s little boy was sitting in the hay and he saddled the filly and put dabney on and held the gate\n",
    "she rode out looking back with her finger to her lips howard s boy put finger to lips too and jumped over the ditch watching her go\n",
    "she thought she would ride out by herself one time\n",
    "she only what was in the kitchen milk and biscuits and a bit of ham and a chicken wing and a row of plums sitting in the window\n",
    "flocks of birds flew up from the fields the little filly went delightedly through the wet paths breasting and breaking the dewy nets of spider webs\n",
    "opening morning glories were turned like eyes on her pretty feet\n",
    "the occasional fences smelled sweet their darkened wood swollen with night dew like sap and followingher progress the bayou rustled within ticked and cried\n",
    "the sky was softly blue all over the last rim of sunrise cloud melting into it like the foam on fresh milk\n",
    "with her whip lifted dabney passed troy s house and passed through mound field and far field through the deadening and on toward the trees where the yazoo was\n",
    "turning and going along up here looking through the trees and across the river you could see marmion\n",
    "around the bend in the early light that was still night quiet in the\n",
    "dabney bent her head to the low boughs and then saw the house reflected in the yazoo river an undulant tower with white wings at each side like a hypnotized swamp butterfly spread and dreaming where it alights\n",
    "then the house itself reared delicate and vast with a strict tower up from its reflection and dabney gazed at it counting its rooms\n",
    "marmion had been empty since the same year it was completed 189o when its owner and builder her grandfather james fairchild was killed in the duel he fought with old ronald mcbane and his wife laura allen died broken hearted very soon leaving two poor civil war widowed sisters to bring up the eight children\n",
    "they went back though it crowded them to the grove marmion was too heart breaking\n",
    "honor honor honor the aunts drummed into their ears little denis and battle and george tempe and annie laurie rowena jim allen and primrose\n",
    "to give up your life because you even in that\n",
    "other people s cotton\n",
    "fine glory\n",
    "dabney would not have done it\n",
    "the eagerness with which she was now going to marmion enteringher real life there with troy told her enough all the cotton in the world was not worth one moment of life\n",
    "it made her know that nothing could ever defy her enough to make her leave it\n",
    "how sweet life was and how well she could hold it pluck it eat it lay her cheek to it oh no one else knew\n",
    "the juice of life and the hot delighting taste and the fragrance and warmth to the cheek the mouth\n",
    "she hated the duel for her grandfather actively while the little filly trembled with impatience under her hand and hated being kept standing still\n",
    "everybody in the family had nearly forgotten the old duel by now it was bad about marmion they abandoned the place except dabney whom it had lately come to come to it if there were duels for any cause\n",
    "what was the reason death could be part of a question about the crops for instance\n",
    "yes honor she had been told when she asked questions as a little girl marmion was empty out in the woods because old ronald mcbane at old argyle had not protected his landing where some of the people s cotton for miles around was shipped from his gin grandfather who had a gin too had accused him of it had been challenged called out to pistols on the river bank had been killed instantly\n",
    "but both gins went on the same\n",
    "always resisted and pouted at the story when any of the boys told it when they said bang bang\n",
    "she covered up her ears and wept until they comforted her and gave her something for having made her cry\n",
    "she knew though even the surrender of life was the privilege of fieriness in the blood\n",
    "she felt it in ever find it out\n",
    "not while she could resist and lament the fact that dear life would surrender itself for anything\n",
    "the sun lifted over the trees and struck the face of marmion all the tints of cypress began to shine on it the brightness of age like newness\n",
    "her house\n",
    "and somehow the river always seemed swift here though it was the same river that passed through the bridge where the cotton wagons went over as noisily as a child beating a tin pan and passed the grove where the aunts sat on the porch and cried for a breeze from it\n",
    "as a child she would run off here and throw sticks in just at this spot convinced that they would tear around the curve where the river looked fast only to see them gently waltz and drift here and there\n",
    "she threw a stick in again and once more it went slowly\n",
    "the river was low now\n",
    "in the spring it would be up over where she was now and took the path back toward shellmound\n",
    "i will never give up anything\n",
    "dabney thought bending forward and laying her head against the soft neck\n",
    "never\n",
    "never\n",
    "for i am happy and to give up nothing will prove it\n",
    "i will never give up anything never give up troy or to troy\n",
    "she thought smilingly of troy coming slowly this was the last day slowly figuring sprung all over with red gold hairs\n",
    "shelley could n t stand him because he had hair in his ears\n",
    "she called him hairy ears dabney smiled biting her lip at that small torment\n",
    "the truth was slowness made any fairchild frantic and dabney delighted now again in troy s slowness like a kind of alarm\n",
    "papa never gave up anything she was thinking\n",
    "i am the first thing papa has ever given up\n",
    "oh he hates it\n",
    "he would not tell her how he really felt about her going to troy not anything very true or very bad in life\n",
    "proud and outraged together for the pampering ways of the fairchilds she put the little switch to her filly where she had kissed her\n",
    "the rehearsal was tonight\n",
    "if they did n t say anything to her now or try to stop her it was their last chance\n",
    "and let them try\n",
    "just now while they never guessed she had seen marmion the magnificent temple like castle like house with the pillars springing naked from the ground and the lookout tower and twenty five rooms and inside the wonderful the chandelier chaliced golden in light like the stamen in the lily down hanging\n",
    "the garden the playhouse the maze they had all been before her eyes when she was all by herself even her own boat landing\n",
    "then after she got in and was living there married she wanted it to rain rain sound on the roof like fall like spring bend the lifted bent come alive the way trees looked from windows during storms at night\n",
    "she wanted this to be outside and inside herself sitting in dignity with her cheek on her hand\n",
    "she rode by the thick woods where the whirlpool lay and something made her get off her horse and creep to the bank and look in she almost never did it was so creepy and scary\n",
    "this was a last chance to look before her wedding\n",
    "she parted the thonged vines of the wild grapes thick as legs and looked in\n",
    "there it was\n",
    "she gazed feasting her fear on the dark vaguely stirring water\n",
    "there were more eyes than hers here frog eyes snake eyes\n",
    "she listened to the silence and then heard it stir churn churning in the early morning\n",
    "she saw how the snakes were turning and moving in the water passing across each other just below the surface and now and then a head horridly sticking up\n",
    "the vines shore and in the water more thickly than any roots should grow gray and red and some roots too moved and floated like hair\n",
    "on the other side a turtle on a root opened its mouth and put its tongue out\n",
    "and the whirlpool itself could you doubt it\n",
    "doubt all the stories since childhood of people white and black who had been drowned there people that were dared to swim in this place and of boats that would venture to the center of the pool and begin to go around and everybody fall out and go to the bottom the boat to disappear\n",
    "a beginning of vertigo seized her until she felt herself leaning the whirlpool\n",
    "but she was never as frightened of it as the boys were\n",
    "she looked in while she counted to a hundred and then ran\n",
    "behind her the little filly had been stamping her foot\n",
    "she climbed on her and kissed her neck and galloped back into the fields the deadening far field went under troy s window she drew the reins a moment and cried out rapidly tauntingly all run together like one word wake up jacob day is breaking\n",
    "pea s in the pod and the hoe cake s baking\n",
    "mary get your ash cake done my love\n",
    "was he awake\n",
    "did he hear\n",

    "where on earth was she\n",
    "she s painting her name on her trunk to go to europe india said at her mother s feet\n",
    "she kept her informed about what everybody was doing at all times which she knew though she herself as now might be cutting paper dolls out of the delineator on the hall floor with laura and roxie s little sudie i want you to go to the store for me and get me a spool of strong string for howard s altar\n",

    "it occurredto me in the garden twelve silver ones wo n t go anywhere\n",
    "i ll catch him at the peabody\n",
    "nothing tired ellen herself more than the spectacle of marital bullying but it was the breath of among the children to the telephone while little india smiled in the wake of her pleasure in demanding one more little old thing from pinck\n",
    "oh mama cried shelley running down the stairs into her mother s arms as though something dreadful had that moment happened\n",
    "it s the only pin you ever really had\n",
    "i do n t count your sunburst\n",

    "george walked through and the children all swept around him\n",
    "tempe took hold of him\n",
    "caught in their momentum he looked out at ellen perfectly still as if from a train window\n",
    "no i m going to the grove and have dinner with jim allen and primrose he was saying\n",

    "with waited a moment watching him feeling that there was something radical in george or that some devastating inner picture of their unnecessary ado would flash before his vision now and then\n",
    "there was a kind of ascetic streak in him even she felt timidly\n",
    "left to himself he might not ask for anything of any of them not necessarily\n",
    "no she could not think that for more than a moment\n",
    "he was too good\n",

    "brunswick town lay all around them dead quiet except for the the whirr of pigeons now and then overhead\n",
    "only the old women were home\n",
    "the little houses were many and alike all whitewashed with a green door with stovepipes crooked like elbows of hips behind okra princess feathers and false dragonhead growing around them and china trees over them like umbrellas with chickens with shut eyes in dust holes\n",
    "it was shady like a creek bed\n",
    "the smell of scalding water feathers and iron pots mixed with the smells of darkness\n",
    "here where no grass was let grow on the flat earth that was bare like their feet the old women had it shady secret lazy and cool\n",
    "a devious invisible vine of talk seemed to grow from shady porch to shady porch though all the old women were hidden\n",
